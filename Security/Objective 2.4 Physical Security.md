# Physical Security

## Physical Security Barriers

#### Fencing
Structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts. Fences are
adaptable and well-suited for safeguarding large perimeters around the entire
building

##### Fence Purposes 
- Provides a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should not be violated
  by unauthorized personnel

- Establish a physical barrier against unauthorized entry

- Delay Intruders, which helps provide security personnel with a longer window
  of time to react 

#### Bollards 
Robust, short vertical posts made of steel or concrete, that are designed to
manage or redirect vehicular traffic. Designed to counter vehicular threats in a
specified area 

##### Bollard Purposes 
- Creates a physical barrier that shield pedestrians, structures, and other
  assets from potential vehicular collisions

- Serves as a secondary purpose as a clear visual reminder of where vehicles are
  not permitted to enter

##### Bollard Rating 

**ASTM F2656-07 M30 P1**: Can stop a 15,000-pound vehicle traveling at 30 mph
and not allow a vehicle to move for more than 1m after hitting 

##### Physical Brute Force Attacks

###### Forcible Entry 
Act of gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically
breaking or bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors, or fences

####### Protection  
Reinforce structures to be able to withstand higher impacts and abuse 

###### Tampering with Security Devices
Involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited 

####### Protection 
Have redundancy in physical security measures 

###### Confronting Security Personnel
The direct confrontation or attack of security personnel 

####### Protection 
Security personnel undergo rigorous conflict resolution and self-defense
training to mitigate risk and should always have a quick means of communication
for backup to signal a potential security breach or attack

###### Ramming Barriers with Vehicles
A car, truck or other motorized vehicle to ram into the organizations physical
security barriers 

###### Protection
Reinforce structures to be able to withstand higher impacts and abuse 

## Surveillance

#### Surveillance Systems
Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given
area in order to maintain the security and safety of facilities, including business, 
home, or commonly used public areas.

##### Video Surveillance
Video Surveillance systems give orgs the ability to provide real-time visual
feedback and the capability to review the recorded footage after an incident
along with additional features like, motion detection, night vision, facial
recognition and remote access. Commonly known as `CCTV` - Closed Circuit TV

**PTZ - Pan-Tilt-Zoom**: Can move the camera or its angle to better detect
issues during an intrusion

###### Video Surveillance Categories
- **Wired**: Cameras with internet access over Ethernet

- **Wireless**: Cameras with internet access over Wi-Fi. Susceptible to frequency
  jamming

- **Outdoor**: Camera that can withstand the elements

- **Indoor**: Camera meant for inside use that is less expensive than outdoor
  models

##### Security Guards 
Flexible and adaptable forms of surveillance that organizations use that can
respond to security events, make judgment calls, and deter attacks. They also
help reassure staff or customers that they are safe

##### Lighting
Proper lighting is crucial for conducting effective surveillance using both
video and security guards. Reduces shadows and hiding spots inhasing the quality
of visibility for security access points

##### Sensors
Devices that detect and respond to external changes in the environment and
convert the information into readable signals or data, There are generally four
categories of sensors:

- **Infrared**: Detect changes in infrared radiation that is emitted by warm
  bodies like humans or animals

- **Pressure**: Activated when a specified minimum amount of weight is detected 

- **Microwave**: Detect movement in an area by emitting microwave pulses and
  measuring their reflection of moving objects

- **Ultrasonic**: Measure the reflection of ultrasonic waves off moving objects 

#### Bypassing Surveillance Systems

**Visual Obstruction**: Blocking the camera's line of sight

**Blind Sensors and Cameras**: Overwhelming the sensor or camera with a sudden
burst of light to render it ineffective for a limited period of time 

**Acoustic Interference**: Jamming or playing loud music to disrupt the
microphone's functionality 

**Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)**: Jamming the signals that surveillance
systems rely on to monitor the environment

**Physical Environment Attacks**: Exploiting the environment around the
surveillance equipment to compromise its functionality

##### Protections 

- Tamper Alarms

- Backup UPS

- Encrypt Frequencies

## Access Points

#### Access Control Vestibules
Double Door system that is designed with two doors that are electronically
controlled to ensure that only one door can be opened at a given time. Often
combined with other measures to create a comprehensive security framework. This
prevents piggybacking and tailgating

#### Access Badges
Designed to act as a authorized individuals key to unlock doors, systems, or
access control vestibules they are authorized to use. These usually use one of
the following technologies:

- RFID - Radio-Frequency Identification

- NFC - Near-Field Communication

- Magnetic Strips

##### Access Badge Cloning 
Prevalent vulnerabilities in terms of the RFID and NFC technologies is the
ability to easily conduct access badge cloning to bypass your authentication
systems. Or copying the data from an RFID or NFC card or badge onto another
device

###### Cloning Steps 

1. An attacker can use a handheld RFID or NFC reader to capture data from a
   victims card and store it for further processing

2. Extracts the relevant authentication credentials from the card

3. Transfer the extracted data into a blank RFID or NFC card

4. Use the cloned badge to gain unauthorized access 

###### Prevent Cloning 

- Implement advanced encryption in card-based authentication systems

- Implement MFA 

- Regularly update the security protocols

- Educate the users

- Use of shielded wallets or sleeves

- Monitor and audit access logs

#### Door Locks
Physical Security Control that is designed to secure entryways by resricting
and regulating access to a particular space or property

- Padlock: use a key and tumbler system to unlock, easy to lockpick

- Combination Lock: Requires a pin to unlock. Harder to crack and can be
  configured so each person has their own unique identification number

- Wireless Signals: Use NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or RFID to unlock

- Biometric Locks: Use biometric data to unlock. Fingerprints or facial
  recognition

    * FAR - False Acceptance Rate 

    * FRR - False Rejection Rate

    * CER - Crossover Error Rate. lower the better

- Cipher Lock: Mechanical Combination Lock
