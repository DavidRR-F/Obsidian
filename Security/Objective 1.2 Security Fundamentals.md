## Security

#### Information Security 
The  act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful
modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction

#### Information System Security
The act of protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data

#### AAA -  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

- `Authentication`: the process of verifying the identity of a user or system
- `Authorization`: defines what actions or resources a user can access
- `Accounting`: the act of tracking user activities and resource useage,
typically for audit or billing purposes

### Security Controls
`Security Controls` are measurements or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks
and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
systems and data

#### Security Control Categories
- Technical
- Managerial
- Operational
- Physical

#### Security Control Types
- Preventative
- Deterrent
- Detective
- Corrective
- Compensating
- Directive

### Zero Trust
Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or
outside of the organization, should be trusted by default

#### Control Plane
Consists of the adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy-driven
access control, and secured zones

#### Data Plane
Focused on the subject/system. policy engine, policy administrator, and
establishing policy enforcement points

## Threats and Vulnerabilities


$$
\huge \neg Threat \lor \neg Vulnerability = \neg Risk
$$

#### Vulnerabilities
Any weakness in a system design or implementation that can be exploited:
Software bugs, Misconfigured software, Improperly protected network devices,
Missing security patches, Lack of physical security, etc..

#### Threats
any potential danger that can exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm or damage to systems, data, or networks

#### Risk Management
`Risk Managerment` is finding different ways to minimize the likelihood of an
outcome and achieve the desired outcomes

## Confidentiality
Refers to protection of information from unauthorized access.

#### Confidentiality Purposes 
Confidentiality has three main purposes: 

**Protecting personal privacy**: Protecting employees from having their personal data accessible without their consent

**Maintaining a business advantage**: Protecting a business's proprietary data to be able to maintain a competitive
advantage in the industry

**Achieving regulatory compliance**: Organizations are required to maintain a level of confidentiality for sensitive
data in their position including personally identifiable information (PII),
protected health information (PHI), and various types of financial data

#### Confidentiality Security
There are five primary ways to maintain confidentiality:

**Encryption**: The process of converting data into cipher text to prevent unauthorized access

**Access Controls**: Ensures only authorized personnel can access certain types
of data

**Data Masking**: a method that involves obscuring data within a database to
make it inaccessible for unauthorized users while retaining the real data's
authenticity and use for authorized users

**Physical Security measures**: Used to ensure confidentiality for physical
types of data and for digital information contained on servers and workstations

**Training and awareness**: Conducting regular training on the security
awareness best practices that employees can use to protect the organizations
sensitive data


## Review Questions
