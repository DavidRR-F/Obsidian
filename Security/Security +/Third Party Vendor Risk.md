# Supply Chain
## Supply Chain Risk

### Hardware

- Conduct rigorous supply chain assessments to track the origins of the hardware and determine the integrity of the components
- Purchase of additional hardware from secondary or aftermarket sources can add risk to the operations of a organization because of potential tampering of the devices

### Software

- Software Developers/Providers are integral cogs in the supply chains and any 3rd party software should be checked to ensure it is properly licensed, authentic, and free of known vulnerabilities
- Should be scanned with an anti-malware solution to be sure it is free of any malicious code. This is much easier with open source software since you can review the entire code base

### Service Providers

- Evaluate data security measures
- Ensure confidentiality and integrity
- Assess cyber security protocols
- Response to the security breach

## Supply Chain Attacks

Attack that involves targeting a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target

### Hardware

- Counterfeit devices
- Deliberate inbreeding of rootkits

### Software

Exploited software vulnerabilities in 3rd party vendor software that can effect multiple if not all of their clients

#### CHIPS Act

U.S federal statute that provides roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost research and manufacturing of semiconductors inside the U.S

## Contracts and Agreements

**Basic Contract**: Versatile tool that formally establishes a relationship between two parties

**SLA - Service-Level Agreement**: The standard of service a client can expect from a provider

**MOA - Memorandum of Agreement**: Formal and outlines the specific responsibilities and roles of the involved parties

**MOU - Memorandum of Understanding**: Less binding and more of a declaration of mutual intent

**SOW - Statement of Work**: Used to specify details for a particular project

**NDA - Non-Disclosure Agreement**: Commitment to privacy that ensures that any sensitive information shared during negotiations remains confidential between both parties

**BPA - Business Partnership Agreement**: Document that goes a step beyond the basic contract when two entities decide to pool their resources for mutual benefit
# Vendors
## Vendor Assessment

Process that organizations implement to evaluate the security, reliability, and performance of external entities

**Vendors**: Businesses or individuals that provide goods or services to an organization 

**Suppliers**: Individuals involved in the production and delivery of products or parts of products

**Service Providers**: Individuals hired by companies to manage IT services on behalf of an organization

### Assessments

**Penetration Testing**: Simulated cyberattack against the supplier's system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities 

**Internal Audit**: Vendor's self-assessment where they evaluate their own practices against industry standards or organizational requirements

**Independent Assessment**: Evaluation conducted by third-party entities that have no stake in the organizations's or vendor's operations

**Supply Chain Analysis**: Used to dive deep into a vendor's entire supply chain and assess the security and reliability of each link

## Vendor Selection and Monitoring

### Selection

**Due Diligence**: Rigorous evaluation that goes beyond surface-level credentials
- Financial Stability 
- Operational History
- Client Testimonials 
- On-the-ground Practices

**Conflict of Interest**: Arises when personal or financial relationships could potentially cloud the judgment of individuals involved in vendor selection

**Vendor Questionnaires**: Comprehensive documents that potential vendors fill out to offer insights into the operations, capabilities, and compliance
- Data Redundancy Measures
- Security Protocols
- Uptime Guarantees 
- Disaster Recovery Plans

**Rules of Engagement**: Guidelines that dictate the terns of interaction between an organization and its potential vendors
- Communication protocols 
- Data sharing policies 
- Negotiation boundaries

### Monitoring

Mechanism to ensure that the chose vendors still aligns with the organizational needs and standards such as performance reviews

**Feedback Loops**: Involve a two-way communication channel where both the organization and the vendor share feedback
