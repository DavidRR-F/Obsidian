CentOS, which stands for Community Enterprise Operating System, is an open-source Linux distribution. It was built to provide a free computing platform that is functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

Historically, CentOS was widely used in server environments due to its robustness and stability, which it inherited from RHEL. It was popular among system administrators, developers, and in various enterprise contexts due to its no-cost availability and strong community support.

In December 2020, Red Hat announced a shift in the CentOS projectâ€™s focus, transforming CentOS Linux from a stable, downstream distribution of RHEL to an upstream development platform named CentOS Stream. This change led to significant discussions and considerations in the Linux community because CentOS Stream serves as a rolling-release distribution that is situated just ahead of RHEL in terms of features and updates, contrasting with the traditional, stable nature of previous CentOS releases.

Key Characteristics of CentOS:

- **Free and Open Source**: Anyone can use and modify CentOS without incurring licensing costs.
    
- **Compatibility with RHEL**: Before the shift to CentOS Stream, CentOS was nearly binary compatible with RHEL, making it a desirable choice for users who needed RHEL compatibility without the associated costs.
    
- **CentOS Stream**: CentOS Stream provides a glimpse into what the next minor RHEL release will look like, allowing developers to have a say in the development process.
    
- **Community-Driven**: While owned by Red Hat, CentOS has a vibrant community that contributes to its development, testing, and support.
    
- **Enterprise-Level Stability**: Historically renowned for its stability and robustness for production environments.
    
- **Widespread Use**: Used globally in various IT environments such as web servers, database servers, and in numerous other infrastructure-related setups.
    
- **Security**: Offers strong security features, including SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), which enables administrators to have more control over who can access the system.
    

CentOS has been a foundation for many web hosts, data centers, and individual developers and administrators for many years. With the shift towards CentOS Stream, the distribution now also plays a vital role in aiding the development and testing of future RHEL releases.
