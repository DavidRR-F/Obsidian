### Differential Backup

![[Pasted image 20240321123220.png]]

**Definition**: A differential backup copies all changes made since the last full backup. Each differential backup includes all changes since that full backup, not just the changes since the last differential backup.

**Key Features**:

- **Storage Efficiency**: Consumes less storage than performing full backups each time, as only changes since the last full backup are saved.
- **Restoration Process**: To restore data, only the last full backup and the last differential backup are needed.
- **Growing Size Over Time**: As time progresses from the last full backup, differential backups will increase in size.

**Use Cases**: Useful for environments where data changes are moderate and a balance between backup speed, restoration speed, and storage efficiency is needed.

### Incremental Backup

![[Pasted image 20240321123416.png]]

**Definition**: An incremental backup saves only the data that has changed since the last backup, regardless of whether that was a full or another incremental backup.

**Key Features**:

- **Storage and Speed**: Highly efficient in terms of storage space and speed, as only the most recent changes are backed up.
- **Complex Restoration**: Restoring data requires the last full backup plus all subsequent incremental backups, which can be time-consuming and complex.
- **Frequent Use**: Often used for daily backups to minimize storage space and backup time.

**Use Cases**: Best suited for environments where minimizing storage space and reducing backup time are priorities, and where the complexity of restoration can be managed.

### Snapshots

**Definition**: A snapshot is a point-in-time representation of the state of a system or data. Unlike traditional backups, snapshots capture the state of a system at a particular moment, often used in virtualized environments.

**Key Features**:

- **Speed**: Snapshots can be created quickly, with minimal impact on system resources.
- **Convenience**: Allows for rapid restoration to the snapshot point, useful for testing and development environments.
- **Not a Complete Backup Solution**: Snapshots depend on the original data and are not suitable as the sole method for data backup since they can be affected if the original data is compromised.

**Use Cases**: Snapshots are particularly useful for short-term backups, testing, and development environments where quick recovery and minimal data loss are crucial.

# Mean Time Backup Metrics
