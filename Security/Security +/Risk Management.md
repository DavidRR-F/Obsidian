# Risk Management
Fundamental process that involves identifying, analyzing, treating, monitoring, and reporting risks

## Risk Assessment Frequency
The regularity with which risk assessments are conducted within an organization

There are four kinds of risk assessments: 

**Ad-Hoc**: Conducted as needed, often in response to a specific event or situation that has the potential to introduce new risks or change the nature of existing risks

**Recurring**: Conducted at regular intervals, such as annually, quarterly, or monthly

**One-Time**: Conducted for a specific purpose and are not repeated. Used when Constructing a project, implementing a new it system, or organizational change

**Continuous**: Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risks

## Risk Identification
Recognizing potential risks that could negatively impact an organization's ability to operate or achieve its objectives

### Business Impact Analysis
Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organization's business functions and processes

**RTO - Recovery Time Objective**: It represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severely impacts the organization. aka system down time tolerance 

**RPO - Recovery Point Objective**: It represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. aka data loss tolerance

**MTTR - Mean Time to Repair**: It represents the average time required to repair a failed component or system 

**MTBF - Mean Time Between Failure**: It represents the average time between failures

## Risk Register (Risk Log)
A Document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies

### Risk Register Components

**Risk Description**: Entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk

**Risk Impact**: Potential consequences if the risk materializes

**Risk Likelihood/Probability**: Chance of a particular risk occurring

**Risk Outcome**: Result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood

**Risk Level/Threshold**: Determined by combining the impact and likelihood

**Cost**: Pertains to its financial impact on the project including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of risk mitigation

### Organizational Risk Components

**Risk Tolerance/Acceptance**: Refers to the organization or individuals willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals

**Risk Appetite**: Signifies an organization's willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals
- Expansionary: open to taking more risk in the hopes of achieving greater returns
- Conservative: Implies that an organization favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns
- Neutral: Signifies a balance between risk and return

**KRI - Key Risk Indicators**: Essential predictive metrics used by organizations to signal rising risk levels in different parts of the enterprise

**Risk Owner**: Person or group responsible for managing the risk

## Qualitative Risk Analysis
A method of assessing risks based on their potential likelihood of their occurrence and is a subjective and high level view of risks

- This method is subjective and relies the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders 
- Likelihood and probability refer to the chance of a particular risk occurring
- the impact refers the the potential consequences if the risk materializes

## Quantitative Risk Analysis
A method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measurements and is a objective and numerical evaluation of risks

**EF - Exposure Factor**: Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event. Represented by percentage

**SLE - Single Loss Expectancy**: Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event.

$$
SLE = Asset Value * EF
$$

**ARO - Annualized Rate of Occurrence**: Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year

**ALE - Annualized Loss Expectancy**: Expected annual loss from a risk

$$
ALE = SLE * ARO
$$
## Risk Management Strategies

**Risk Transference/Sharing**: Involves shifting the risk from the organization to another party

- ***Contract Indemnity Clause***: A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the other's harm, liability, or loss stemming from the contract

**Risk Acceptance**: Recognizing a risk and choosing to address it when it arises

- ***Exemption***: Provision that grants an exception from a specific rule or requirement
- ***Exception***: Provision that permits a party to bypass a rule or requirement in certain situations

**Risk Avoidance**: Strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific risk

**Risk Mitigation**: Implementing measures to decrease the likelihood or impact of a risk

## Risk Monitoring and Reporting
Risk monitoring and reporting can help in the following accept of the business:

- Informed decision-making
- Risk mitigation
- Stakeholder communication
- Regulatory compliance
### Risk Monitoring
Involves continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plans, and evaluating their effectiveness during a project's lifecycle

**Residual Risk**: Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures on the initial risk

**Control Risk**: Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time

### Risk Reporting
Process of communicating information about risk management activities. A monthly, or quarterly reporting method that can help identify:

- Potential safety hazards
- Potential financial impacts
- Likelihood of project delays
