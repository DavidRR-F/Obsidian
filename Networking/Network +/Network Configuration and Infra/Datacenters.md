Each plays a vital role in maintaining service continuity and performance.

### Load Balancing

- **Definition**: Load balancing involves distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed by demand. This process helps maximize speed and capacity utilization while ensuring no single server is a point of failure.
- **Implementation**: Load balancers can be implemented as dedicated hardware appliances or as software-defined networking components. They use various algorithms (round-robin, least connections, etc.) to efficiently distribute traffic.

### Clustering

- **Definition**: Clustering refers to the practice of grouping multiple servers so that they work together as a single system to provide higher availability, reliability, and scalability. If one server in the cluster fails, another can take over the load without any downtime.
- **Implementation**: Clusters can be used for different purposes, including load balancing, database management, and file storage, ensuring that services remain available even if individual servers fail.

##### Active-Active Configuration

- **Definition**: An active-active configuration involves two or more systems running simultaneously to handle workloads. This setup provides redundancy and increases capacity since traffic can be split between the systems.
- **Benefits**: Enhances availability and load handling. If one system fails, the others continue to operate, minimizing the risk of service disruption.

### FHRP (First Hop Redundancy Protocols)

- **Definition**: FHRPs, such as HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol), VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), and GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol), are used to provide high availability for the first-hop IP routing between hosts and the gateway. They allow multiple routers/switches to work together, presenting the appearance of a single gateway to the hosts.
- **Implementation**: These protocols automatically manage the failover between equipment, ensuring that if the primary gateway fails, another gateway within the FHRP group takes over, maintaining network connectivity.

##### Active-Passive Configuration

- **Definition**: In an active-passive setup, one system is actively handling workloads while another stands by idle, ready to take over in case the active system fails.
- **Benefits**: Provides a failover solution where the passive system can quickly become active, ensuring continuity of service, although it doesn't enhance capacity in the same way an active-active configuration does.

### PDUs (Power Distribution Units)
