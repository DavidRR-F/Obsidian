## Monitoring Resources

**System Monitoring**: Observation of computer systems, including the utilization and consumption of its resources

**Baseline**: Established performance metrics and data points for standard behavior of a system, network, or application
- Allows detection of deviations and potential issues, enabling proactive troubleshooting and maintenance

**Application Monitoring**: Emphasizes the management and monitoring of software application performance and availability
- New Relic
- App Dynamics

**Infrastructure Monitoring**: Observation of the performance and availability of an organization's physical and virtual infrastructure

## Alerting and Monitoring Activities

**Log Aggregation**: Process of collecting and consolidating log data from various sources into a centralized location
- Consolidated log data provides valuable insights into the system's performance

**Alerting**: Involves setting up notifications to inform relevant stakeholders when specific events or conditions occur

**Scanning**: Involves examining systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities, configuration issues, or other potential problems
- ***Vulnerability Scan***: Checks for vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications by comparing the system's state against databases of vulnerabilities
- ***Configuration Scan***: Checks for misconfigurations that could impact system performance or security
- ***Code Scan***: Checks the source code of an application for potential issues, such as security vulnerabilities or coding errors

**Reporting**: Involves generating summaries or detailed reports based on the collected and analyzed data

**Archiving**: Involves storing data for long-term retention and future reference, including organization's log data, performance data, and incident data

**Alert Response and Remediation/Validation**: Involves taking appropriate actions in response to alerts and ensuring that the identifies issues have been effectively addressed
- ***Remediation***: Steps used to resolve identified issues or vulnerabilities 
- ***Validation***: Involves verifying that the remediation implemented was actually successful and has effectively addressed the given issue or vulnerability
- ***Quarantining***: Isolating a system, network, or application to prevent the spread of a threat and limit its potential impact
- ***Alert Tuning***: Adjusting alert parameters to reduce errors, false positives, and to improve the overall relevance of the alerts being generated by a given system
## Simple Network Management Protocol

*SNMP* is an internet protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior

![[Pasted image 20240824175302.png]]

**Management Information Base**: *MIB*, Used to describe the structure of the management data of a device subsystem using a hierarchical namespace containing object identifiers (OID)

**Granular Trap**: Sent trap messages get a unique objective identifier to distinguish each message as a unique message being received

**Verbose Trap**: traps may be configured to contain all the information about a given alert or event as a payload

## Security Information and Event Management

*SIEM* is a solution that provides real-time or near-real-time analysis of security alerts that are generated by network hardware and applications

**Agent**: Software agent installed on each system, such as a server or workstation, from which the SIEM needs to collect log data

**Agentless**: Under this approach, the SIEM system directly collects log data from each system using standard protocols such as SNMP or WMI

### SIEM Considerations

- Log relevant events and filter irrelevant data
- Establish and document scope of events
- Develop use cases to define a threat
- Plan incident response for a threat or event
- Establish a ticketing system to track events
- Schedule regular threat hunting
- Provide auditors and analysts an evidence trail

### Different SIEMs

**Splunk**: Market-leading big data information gathering and analysis tool that can import machine-generated data via a connector or a visibility add-on

**Elastic Stack**: *ELK*, Collection of free and open-source SIEM tools that provide storage, search, and analysis functions
- Elasticsearch
- Logstash
- Kibana
- Beats

![[Pasted image 20240824181924.png]]

**ArcSight**: SIEM log management and analytics software that can be used for compliance reporting for legislation and regulations loke HIPPA, SOX, and PCI DSS

**QRadar**: SIEM log management, analytics and compliance reporting platform created by IBM

## Data from Security Tools

**Antivirus Software**: Fundamental security tool that protects systems against malware, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware

**Data Loss Prevention Systems**: *DLP Systems*, Used to monitor and control data endpoints, network traffic, and data stored in the cloud to prevent potential data breaches from occurring

**NIDS/NIPS**: Passively identifies any potential threats and Actively blocks or prevents these potential threats

**Firewalls**: Serve as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network

**Vulnerability Scanners**: Tools that identify security weaknesses in a system, including missing patches, incorrect configurations, and other types of known vulnerabilities

## Security Content Automation and Protocol

*SCAP* is a series of open standards that automate vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance for systems in an organization developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

### Schemas

**Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language**: *OVAL*, XML schema for describing system security states and querying vulnerability reports and information

**Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format**: *XCCDF*, XML schema for developing and auditing best-practice configuration checklists and rules

**Asset Reporting Format**: *ARF*, XML schema for expressing information about assets and the relationships between assets and reports

### Asset Enumerations

**Common Configuration Enumeration**: *CCE* scheme for provisioning secure configuration checks across multiple sources

**Common Platform Enumeration**: *CPE* scheme for identifying hardware devices, operating systems, and applications

```bash
cpe:/part:vendor:product:version:update:edition:language
```

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**: *CVE* List of records where each item contains a unique identifier used to describe a publicly known vulnerability

```bash
CVE-2017-0144
```

### Metric System

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System**: *CVSS* Used to provide a numerical score to reflect the severity of a given vulnerability

| Score    | Severity |
| :------- | -------- |
| 0        | None     |
| 0.1-3.9  | Low      |
| 4.0-6.9  | Medium   |
| 7.0-8.9  | High     |
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical |

This does not account for any mitigation already in place

**Benchmark**: Set of security configuration rules for some specific set of products to provide a detailed checklist that can be used to secure systems to a specific baseline

## Netflow and Flow Analysis

**Full Packet Capture**: *FPC* Captures the entire packet, including the header and the payload for all traffic entering and leaving a network

**Flow Analysis**: Relies on a flow collector, which records metadata and statistics rather than recording each frame that passes through the network
- Does not provide actual content
- Rapidly generates visualizations to map network connections, traffic types, and session volumes

**NetFlow**: A Cisco-developed means of reporting network flow info to a structured database
- ***IPFIX***: IP Flow information Export, Defines traffic flows based on shared packet characteristics

**Zeek**: Passively monitors a network like sniffer, but only logs full packet capture data of potential interest
- Performs normalization of the data and stores it as a tab-delimited or JSON-formatted tact file

**Multi Router Traffic Grapher**: *MRTG* Creates graphs showing traffic flows through the network interfaces of routers and switches by polling the appliances using SNMP
