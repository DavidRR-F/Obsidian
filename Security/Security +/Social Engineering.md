# Social Engineering
Manipulative strategy that exploits human psychology to gain unauthorized access
to systems, data, or physical spaces

## Motivational Triggers
The backbone of social engineering lies in the ability of an attacker to trick a
user into doing something for them 

#### Motivational Trigger Types 

**Authority**: the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce
obedience

**Urgency**: Compelling sense of immediacy or time-sensitivity that drives
individuals to act swiftly or prioritize certain actions

**Social Proof**: Psychological phenomenon where individuals look to the
behaviors and actions of others to determine their own decisions tor actions
in similar situations. aka giving something credibility be referral 

**Scarcity**: psychological pressure people fell when they believe a product,
opportunity, or resource is limited or in short supply

**Likability**: It is associated with being nice, friendly, and socially
accepted by others

**Fear**: Feeling afraid or someone or something, as likely to be dangerous,
painful or threatening

## Impersonation 
An attack where an adversary assumes the identity of another person to gain
unauthorized access to resources or steal sensitive data.

- Providing more details helps make the lies and the attacker's impersonation
  more believable

#### Impersonation Types 

**Brand Impersonation**: Specific form of impersonation where an attacker
pretends to represent a legitimate company or brand

**Typosquatting**: a form of cyber attack where an attacker registers a domain
name that is similar to a popular website but contains some kind of common
typographical errors or hijacking sub-domains using primary domains. 
Example: `google.com` -> `gooble.com`

**Watering Hole Attack**: Targeted form of cyber attack where attackers
compromise a specific website or service that their target is known to use

## Pretexting
Pretexting in social engineering refers to the act of creating a fabricated 
scenario or pretext to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential 
information, sensitive or personal data

#### Pretexting Methods

**Creating a Plausible Story**: The social engineer crafts a believable story or 
pretext to engage with the target. This story could involve impersonating someone 
in authority (like a manager or IT support), claiming a shared connection, or 
presenting a situation that requires urgent action.

**Building Trust**: Once engaged, the social engineer works to establish trust 
with the target. This might involve using personal details (gathered from previous 
reconnaissance) or leveraging common interests to make the interaction seem legitimate.

**Extracting Information**: With trust established, the pretexter seeks to extract 
information from the target. This could be login credentials, financial details, 
organizational secrets, or other sensitive data.

**Manipulating Actions**: In some cases, pretexting isn't just about information 
gathering but also about persuading the target to take specific actions, such as 
downloading malicious software, transferring money, or giving physical access 
to secure areas.

## Phishing Attacks 
Fraudulent attack using deceptive emails from trusted sources to trick
individuals into disclosing personal information like passwords and credit card
numbers

#### Phishing Types 

**Spear Phishing**: Used by cybercriminals who are more tightly focused on a
specific group of individuals or organizations

**Whaling**: Spear Phishing that targets high-profile individuals, like
CEO/CFO's

**Business Email Compromise**: Advanced phishing attack that leverages internal
email accounts within a company to manipulate employees into carrying out
malicious actions for the attacker

**Vishing**: Phone-based attack in which the attacker deceives victims into
divulging personal or financial information

**Smishing**: sms phishing, attack that uses text messages to deceive
individuals into sharing their personal information

#### Preventing Phishing 

##### **Anti-phishing campaign**
Vital tool to educating individuals about phishing risks and how to 
recognize potential phishing attempts in user security awareness training

##### **Report Phishing Attempts**
Report suspicious messages to protect your organization from potential 
phishing attacks

###### Key Indicators of Phishing 

- Sense of Urgency in the communication 

- Unusual Requests 

- Mismatched URLs 

- Strange email addresses

- Poor spelling or grammar

## Fraud 
The wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in finacial or personal
gain

**Identity Fraud/Theft**: The use by one person of another person's personal
information, without authorization, to commit a crime or to decieve or defraud
that other person or a third person

    - Fraud: Attacker takes the victim's credit card number and makes charges

    - Theft: Attacker tries to fully assume the identity of their victim

**Scam**: A fraudulent or deceptive act or operation 

    - Invoice Scam: A scam in which a person is tricked into paying for a fake
      invoice for a service or product they did not order 

## Influence Campaigns 
Coordinated efforts to affect public perception or behavior towards a particular
cause, individual, or groups by actors such as nation-states and hacktivists

**Misinformation**: Inaccurate information shared unintentionally or without
malicious intent

**Disinformation**: Intentional spread of false information to deceive or
mislead

***Note***: Counters to influence campaigns involves promoting media literacy, 
transparency, and regulation


## Other Social Engineering Attacks 

**Diversion Theft**: Manipulating a situation or creating a distraction to
steal valuable items or information. 
    - DNS Spoofing

**Hoax**: Malicious deception that is often spread through social media, email,
or other communication channels

    - Phishing Attacks 

    - Impersonation Attacks 

**Shoulder Surfing**: Looking over someone's shoulder to gather personal
information 

**Dumpster Diving**: Searching through trash to find valuable information 

**Eavesdropping**: The process of secretly listening to private conversations 

**Baiting**: Planting a malware-infected device for a victim to find and
unintentionally introduce malware to their organization's system
