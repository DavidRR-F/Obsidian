Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical hacking techniques to gain access to buildings, systems, or data. Here's an overview of various social engineering tactics, highlighting how they're executed and how to protect against them.

### Dumpster Diving

**What It Is**: Dumpster diving involves rummaging through trash to find sensitive documents, information, or assets discarded by an individual or organization. Attackers look for paperwork with personal information, passwords, or any data that can be used in further attacks.

**Protection Measures**: Shred sensitive documents before disposal. Implement policies for the secure disposal of materials containing confidential information.

### Whaling

**What It Is**: Whaling is a targeted form of phishing aimed at senior executives ("big fish") within an organization. The goal is to deceive them into revealing sensitive company information or initiating unauthorized financial transactions.

**Protection Measures**: Educate executives on the risks of phishing, encourage skepticism in email communications, especially concerning requests for financial transactions or sensitive data, and implement multi-level authentication and verification processes for financial operations.

### Shoulder Surfing

**What It Is**: Shoulder surfing involves looking over someone's shoulder to obtain confidential information, such as passwords, PIN numbers, or other sensitive data, usually in public places.

**Protection Measures**: Employees should be cautious when entering sensitive information on their devices in public or within view of others. Use privacy screens on monitors and devices to prevent visual snooping.

### Eavesdropping

**What It Is**: Eavesdropping involves secretly listening to private conversations or intercepting data transmitted over unsecured networks. It can be conducted physically by listening to someoneâ€™s conversation or technically through network interception.

**Protection Measures**: Use encrypted communication channels, conduct sensitive conversations in secure environments, and ensure that networks are secure through encryption and VPNs.

### Tailgating/Piggybacking

**What It Is**: Tailgating or piggybacking refers to an unauthorized person following an authorized individual into a restricted area without the proper credentials. The attacker takes advantage of polite social behavior to gain access.

**Protection Measures**: Implement and enforce strict access control policies, including the use of security badges and electronic access control systems. Educate employees not to hold doors open for strangers and to challenge unidentified individuals.

### Access Control Vestibule (Mantrap)

**What It Is**: An access control vestibule, or mantrap, is a physical security system consisting of two or more interlocking doors. The system is designed to control access to a secure area by allowing only one person to pass through at a time, verifying their authorization before allowing access to the next door.

**Protection Measures**: Mantraps are used to prevent tailgating and piggybacking. Ensure they are correctly maintained and integrated with identification systems like biometrics or key cards for effective security.

### Masquerading/Impersonating

**What It Is**: Masquerading or impersonating involves an attacker pretending to be someone else (like a company executive, a tech support employee, or a trusted vendor) to gain unauthorized access to information or resources.

**Protection Measures**: Verification procedures should be in place for identifying individuals, especially in requests involving access to sensitive information or systems. Training employees to recognize and respond to suspicious requests is also critical.
