### Password Attacks
- A dictionary attack takes advantage of weak passwords by trying variants of dictionary words and common passwords.
- A brute force attack tries every possible password and is the only password attack that is guaranteed to work eventually.
- A rainbow table attack targets unsalted passwords by precomputing a lookup table of passwords and their corresponding hashes.
- A password spraying attack takes advantage of weak passwords by trying the same, weak password for many different accounts.
