## Audits

Systematic evaluations of an organization's information systems, applications, and security controls

### Internal

Systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of internal controls, compliance, and integrity of information systems and processes 

#### Access Control Audit Process

1. Review access control policies and procedure for alignment with best practices and regulatory requirements
2. Examination of access rights of user
3. Verify access rights processes, including approvals and timely revocation
4. Test the effectiveness of access controls
5. Document findings to serve as basis for recommending access control policy and procedure improvements

#### Internal Compliance Requirements

Ensuring that information systems and security practices meet established standards, regulations, and laws. Involving quarterly and/or yearly auditing for internal compliance

### External

Systematic evaluations carried out by external entities to assess an organization's information systems and controls. The aim of an external audit is to uncover deficiencies in policies and controls to ensure alignment with diverse regulatory standards

#### Audit Committee

Group of people responsible for supervising the organization's audit and compliance functions

## Assessments

Performing a detailed analysis of an organization's security systems to identify vulnerabilities and risks

### Internal

An in-depth analysis to identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems.

#### Self-Assessment

Internal review conducted by an organization to gauge its adherence to particular standards or regulations. A large organization may have a dedicated internal assessment team that travels throughout the enterprise

#### Web Deployment Assessment

1. Conducting threat modeling exercise where potential threats are identified
2. Assessing vulnerabilities by using automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques
3. Performing risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact of identified threats
4. Recommending mitigation strategies based on the results

### External

Detailed analysis conducted by independent entities to identify vulnerabilities and risks

**Regulatory Compliance**: Objective that organizations aim to reach in adherence to applicable laws, policies, and regulations

**Examination**: Comprehensive security infrastructure inspections that are conducted externally

## Penetration Testing

Simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities

**Physical**: Testing an organization's physical security through testing locks, access cards, security cameras, and other protective measures

**Red Teaming**: Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities

**Blue Teaming**: Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing, incident response times

**Purple Teaming**: Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test

### Reconnaissance

An initial phase where critical information about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success

**Active**: Direct engagement with the target system, offering more information but with a higher detection risk

**Passive**: Gathering information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data

#### Environments

**Known**: Detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received prior to the test

**Partially Known**: Involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system

**Unknown**: Testers receive minimal to no information about the target system

#### Basic Penetration Test

**Metasploit**: Multi-purpose computer security and penetration testing framework that encompasses a wide array of powerful tools, enabling the execution of penetration tests

## Attestation of Findings

Process that involves the formal validation or confirmation provided by an entity that is used to assert the accuracy and authenticity of specific information

**Letter of Attestation**: is discussed to provide proof of a conducted penetration test.

**Software Attestation**: Involves validating the integrity of software by checking that it hasn't been tampered with or altered maliciously

**Hardware Attestation**: Validating the integrity of hardware components

**System Attestation**: Validating the security posture of a system

**Attestation in Internal Audits**: Providing attestation on things such as:
- Accuracy of financial records
- Effectiveness of risk management strategies
- Adherence to internal policies and procedures

**Attestation in External Audits**: Providing attestation on things such as:
- Financial Statements
- Regulatory Compliance
- Operational Efficiency
