# Rescue/Emergency Mode

Emergency mode in Linux, specifically in systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives, is a minimalistic boot mode used for troubleshooting and system recovery. When a Linux system boots into emergency mode, it provides an environment to perform critical tasks, particularly when standard booting procedures fail or there are severe system issues.

# GRUB Menu

The GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) menu is a critical component in the boot process of most Linux-based systems, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Ubuntu, Fedora, and many others. It provides a user interface to interact with the bootloader, which is responsible for loading the operating system kernel and initial RAM disk.

# Virtual Consoles (TTYs)

  
In the context of Linux, a TTY (Teletype) refers to a terminal interface that allows users to interact with the system. Linux provides several virtual consoles or TTYs, typically accessible via combinations like `Ctrl + Alt + F1` to `Ctrl + Alt + F6`. Each virtual console provides a separate login prompt and command-line session. They are useful for system administration, especially when the graphical user interface is not available.
