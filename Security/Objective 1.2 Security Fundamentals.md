## Security

#### Information Security 
The  act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful
modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction

#### Information System Security
The act of protecting the systems that hold and process the critical data

#### AAA -  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

- `Authentication`: the process of verifying the identity of a user or system
- `Authorization`: defines what actions or resources a user can access
- `Accounting`: the act of tracking user activities and resource useage,
typically for audit or billing purposes

### Security Controls
`Security Controls` are measurements or mechanisms put in place to mitigate risks
and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
systems and data

#### Security Control Categories
- Technical
- Managerial
- Operational
- Physical

#### Security Control Types
- Preventative
- Deterrent
- Detective
- Corrective
- Compensating
- Directive

### Zero Trust
Security model that operates on the principle that no one, whether inside or
outside of the organization, should be trusted by default

#### Control Plane
Consists of the adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy-driven
access control, and secured zones

#### Data Plane
Focused on the subject/system. policy engine, policy administrator, and
establishing policy enforcement points

## Threats and Vulnerabilities


$$
\huge \neg Threat \lor \neg Vulnerability = \neg Risk
$$

#### Vulnerabilities
Any weakness in a system design or implementation that can be exploited:
Software bugs, Misconfigured software, Improperly protected network devices,
Missing security patches, Lack of physical security, etc..

#### Threats
any potential danger that can exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm or damage to systems, data, or networks

#### Risk Management
`Risk Managerment` is finding different ways to minimize the likelihood of an
outcome and achieve the desired outcomes

## Confidentiality
Refers to protection of information from unauthorized access.

#### Confidentiality Purposes 

**Protecting personal privacy**: Protecting employees from having their personal data accessible without their consent

**Maintaining a business advantage**: Protecting a business's proprietary data to be able to maintain a competitive
advantage in the industry

**Achieving regulatory compliance**: Organizations are required to maintain a level of confidentiality for sensitive
data in their position including personally identifiable information (PII),
protected health information (PHI), and various types of financial data

#### Confidentiality Security

**Encryption**: The process of converting data into cipher text to prevent unauthorized access

**Access Controls**: Ensures only authorized personnel can access certain types
of data

**Data Masking**: a method that involves obscuring data within a database to
make it inaccessible for unauthorized users while retaining the real data's
authenticity and use for authorized users

**Physical Security measures**: Used to ensure confidentiality for physical
types of data and for digital information contained on servers and workstations

**Training and awareness**: Conducting regular training on the security
awareness best practices that employees can use to protect the organizations
sensitive data

## Integrity 
**Integrity** ensures information and data remiains accurate and unchanged from
their original state unless intetionally modified by authorized individuals. It
verifies the accuracy and trustworthoness of the data of its entire lifecycle

#### Integrity Purposes

**Ensure Data Accuracy**: Maintining data integrity ensures that decisions are
made based on correct information and with the expected outcomes

**Maintain Trust**: If users can't trust the data they are recieving they can't
be expected to trust your applications, systems, or networks

**Ensure System Operability**: If data is corrupted the system are likely to
malfuction which can lead to unexpected behaviours and excessive system
downtimes.

#### Integrity Security

##### **Hashing** 

The process of converting data into a fixed size value. Even if a
small amount of data is changed, the hash will change drastically which can
indicate that something has happened to the data. A ***Hash Digest*** or 
***Digital Fingerprint*** is a fixed-size string or value generated by a hashing 
algorithm. By comparing the hash of received data with a previously generated 
hash digest, one can determine if the data has been altered or corrupted.
Example hash functions include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) and MD5
(Message Digest Algorithm 5), although MD5 is considered less secure due to 
vulnerabilities.

###### Hashing Steps

1. Before creating a digital signature, the data (message, document, or file) that needs 
   to be signed is processed through a cryptographic hash function.

2. A hash function takes an input (the data) of any size and produces a fixed-size output, 
   known as a hash value or hash digest. 

Properties of a hash function include producing a unique hash for each unique input, 
being deterministic (same input always yields the same output), and being computationally 
efficient.

##### **Digital Signatures**

A cryptographic technique used to provide authenticity, 
integrity, and non-repudiation for digital documents or messages. Digital signatures 
work in conjunction with hashing to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and 
non-repudiation of digital data.

###### Digital Signing Steps 

1. After the data is hashed to produce a hash digest, the digital signing
   process begins with the sender (signer) using their private key to encrypt
   the hash digest.

2. The recipient (verifier) of the digitally signed data uses the corresponding 
   public key of the signer to decrypt the digital signature. 

Once decrypted, the verifier obtains the original hash digest of the data. If the computed 
hash digest matches the decrypted hash digest (which was originally signed), it confirms 
the integrity and authenticity of the data.

##### **Checksums**

A method to verify the integrity of data during transmission. By
checking the sender checksum of the trasmitted data with the recievers 
calculated checksum for the recieved data to determine if any unintended changes
in the data have occured. Often used in situations where a full cryptographic hash
function might be overkill due to computational resources or time constraints

###### Checksum Steps

1. The checksum value is generated by a checksum algorithm and appened to the
   data itself (data + checksum)

2. When the data is accessed or recieved the checksum is recalculated using the
   same algorithm. If the recalculated checksum matches the transmitted
   checksum, the data has likely not been altered

While checksums can detect errors, they are not foolproof against deliberate 
tampering because they are not designed with cryptographic security in mind.
