The `config` folder in an Apache Airflow setup is typically used to store configuration files that are used to customize the behavior of your Airflow instance. This can include a variety of file types, such as `.cfg`, `.json`, or `.yaml` files, depending on your use case.

Here are some common use cases for what might go into a `config` folder:

### 1. **Airflow Configuration Files:**

- **`airflow.cfg`**: Although `airflow.cfg` is usually found in the `AIRFLOW_HOME` directory, you might have additional configuration files or variations that you store in a `config` folder for different environments or use cases.

### 2. **Custom Configuration Files:**

- **`webserver_config.py`**: This file is used to configure the Airflow webserver and UI. It might contain settings related to RBAC, default views, and other webserver-related settings.

### 3. **Connection and Variable Files:**

- **`connections.json`**, **`variables.json`**: You might have JSON files that are used to import connections and variables into Airflow using the CLI. This is useful for managing these objects in code and version control.

### 4. **Security and Authentication:**

- **SSL certificates**: If you're setting up HTTPS for your Airflow webserver, you might store your SSL certificate and key files in the `config` folder.
- **OAuth or SSO configurations**: If you have specific configurations for OAuth or Single Sign-On, you might store these in the `config` folder.

### 5. **Custom Scripts:**

- **Scripts for DAGs**: Sometimes, you might have SQL scripts, Python scripts, or other code files that are used by your DAGs. These can be organized into the `config` folder.

### 6. **Log Configuration:**

- **`log_config.py`**: A Python file that configures logging for Airflow. You can define how logs are formatted, where they are stored, and set up additional handlers for sending logs to external platforms.
