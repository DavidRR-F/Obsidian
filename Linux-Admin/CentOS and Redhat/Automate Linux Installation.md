## Kickstart

Kickstart is a system installation and configuration tool used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora) to automate and streamline the process of installing and configuring the Linux operating system on multiple systems. Kickstart allows administrators to create a configuration file (known as a Kickstart file or Kickstart script) that specifies installation options, system settings, package selection, disk partitioning, and post-installation tasks. This file can then be used to perform unattended and consistent installations across multiple servers or workstations.

To use Kickstart you need:
- a Kickstart server and create/edit a Kickstart file
- Make the Kickstart file available on the network location
- Make the installation source available
- Make the boot media available for client which will be used to begin installation
- Start the Kickstart installation

Here are some key features and concepts related to Kickstart:

1. **Unattended Installation**: Kickstart enables unattended or "hands-off" installations, reducing the need for manual intervention during the installation process. This is particularly useful when deploying Linux on a large number of systems with identical or similar configurations.
    
2. **Kickstart File**: The core of Kickstart is the Kickstart file, which is a plain text configuration file that contains directives and options specifying how the installation should be carried out. This file can be customized to meet the specific requirements of your environment.
    
3. **Automated Partitioning**: Kickstart allows you to define the partition layout for your systems, including the creation, formatting, and mounting of partitions. You can specify disk devices, partition sizes, and file systems.
    
4. **Package Selection**: You can specify which packages and software components should be installed during the installation process. This allows you to create customized Linux installations tailored to your needs.
    
5. **Network Configuration**: Kickstart can configure network settings, including IP addresses, hostnames, DNS servers, and network interfaces. This ensures that systems are properly connected to the network after installation.
    
6. **Post-Installation Scripts**: Kickstart supports the execution of post-installation scripts, which can be used to perform additional configuration, software installation, or customization tasks after the OS is installed.
    
7. **Kickstart Boot Media**: To initiate a Kickstart installation, you can create bootable media (e.g., DVD, USB drive, or network boot) that includes the Kickstart file. During the installation process, the system reads the Kickstart file and performs the installation based on its instructions.
    
8. **Reproducibility**: Kickstart promotes consistency and reproducibility in system deployments. Once a Kickstart file is created, it can be reused to perform identical installations on multiple systems, ensuring that all systems are configured the same way.
    
9. **Customization**: Kickstart is highly customizable, allowing you to create different Kickstart files for different system configurations or roles within your organization.
    

A basic Kickstart file might look like this:

```bash
# Specify installation method (e.g., DVD, HTTP, FTP) 
install 
url --url=http://server.example.com/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/  

# Configure system settings 
network --bootproto=dhcp 
keyboard --vckeymap=us --xlayouts='us'  

# Partitioning 
autopart --type=plain 
clearpart --all --initlabel  

# Package selection 
%packages
@base 
@core 
vim 
%end  

# Post-installation scripts (optional) 
%post 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "Custom post-installation script" 
# Additional customizations here 
%end
```

To perform a Kickstart installation, you typically boot the target system from the appropriate installation media and specify the location of the Kickstart file (e.g., via a kernel command-line parameter).
