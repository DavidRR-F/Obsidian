# Malware
Any software that is designed to infiltrate a computer system without the user's
knowledge by creating a threat vector and provide an attack vector.

- Requires the user to take some action 

#### Threat Vector 
Specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine. Like
Unpatched Software, Installing code, Phishing Campaign, Other vulnerabilities.
How the hacker breaks into the system

#### Attack Vector 
A means by which an attacker gains access to a computer to infect the system
with malware. How the hacker breaks into the system and infects it


## Viruses
Malicious code that's run on the users machine without the user's knowledge and
allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run 

#### Virus Types 

**Boot Sector Virus**: Stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded
into memory whenever the computer boots up 

**Macro Virus**: a form of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside
another document so that when that document is opened by the user, the virus
executes

**Program Virus**: Tries to find executable or application files to infect them
with malicious code 

**Multipartite Virus**: A combination of a boot sector and program virus loads
at boot time and inserts itself into a program 

**Encrypted Virus**: Designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting
its malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any antivirus software

**Polymorphic Virus**: Advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of
just encrypting the contents, it will actually change the virus's code each time
it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it to evade
detection

**Metamorphic Virus**: Able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to
infect a given file. aka a more advanced polymorphic virus 

**Stealth Virus**: Not necessarily a specific type of virus as much as a
technique used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus
software

**Armored Virus**: Have a layer of protection to confuse a program or a person
who's trying to analyze it 

**Hoax**: a form of technical social engineering that attempts to scare end
users into taking undesirable action on their system

## Worms
Piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself
without any user interaction

- can replicate without user interaction 

- Can infect the workstation and other computing assets

- Can cause disruptions to the normal network traffic since they are constantly
  trying to replicate and spread across the network 

## Trojans
A piece of malicious software that is disguised  as a piece of harmless or
desirable software

**RAT - Remote Access Trojan**: Type of Trojan that is widely used by modern
attackers because it provides the attacker with remote control of a victims
machine

## Ransomware
Type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system
or its data by encrypting it until a ransom is paid to the attacker

#### Prevention Best Practices

- Conducting Regular Backups

- Installing Regular Software Updates

- Providing Security Awareness Training

- Implementing MFA

#### Response Best Practices 

- Never Pay Ransomware 

- Disconnect Infected Systems

- Notify Authorities

- Restore Data from known good backups

## Botnets
Network of compromised computers or devices controlled remotely by malicious
actors

**Zombie**: Name of a compromised computer of device that is a part of a botnet and used to
perform tasks using remote commands

**Command and Control Node**: Responsible for managing and coordinating the
activities of other nodes or devices within a network

#### Botnet uses 
- DDoS Attacks 

- Phishing Campaigns

- Storing illegal material

- Combined processing power


## Rootkits
Type of software that is designed to gain administrative-level control over a
given computer system without being detected and allows attacker to
install/delete programs, open/shut ports, and any other root level access
actions

#### Privilege Level

**Kernel Mode (Ring 0)**: Allows a system to control access to thing like device
drivers, sound card, and monitor

**Root (Ring 1)**: Administrative access level

**User (Ring 3)**: User based access level

#### Rootkit Techniques

**DLL Injection**: used to run arbitrary code within the address space of
another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library using a `shim` or a
piece of software code that is placed between two components

## Backdoors and Logic Bombs

### Backdoor 
Used by developers to bypass the normal security and authentication functions of
the public facing side of a system that could potentially be used to gain
unauthorized access

### Logic Bombs
Malicious code that is inserted into a program, and will only execute when
certain conditions have been met

## Keylogger
Piece of software or hardware the records every single keystroke that is made on
a computer or mobile device which can be used in Identity  theft, financial
fraud, and corporate espionage

#### Prevention Best Practices 
- Perform regular Updates

- Anti Malware Solutions

- Phishing Awareness Campaigns

- Implement MFA 

- Encrypt Keystrokes being sent to systems 

- Perform physical Checks of Desktops, Laptops, and Servers

## Spyware and Bloatware

### Spyware 
Type of malicious software that is designed to gather and send information about
a user or organization. Often bundled with  other software, instanlled through
malicious websites, or installed when users click deceptive pop-up
advertisements

### Bloatware
