### Application (Service):
    
An application, often referred to as a service when it runs in the background, is a software program designed to perform specific tasks or provide specific functionality. Applications can be command-line tools or graphical user interface (GUI) programs. In the context of a server or Linux system, a service typically refers to a program that runs continuously to provide some functionality, such as a web server (e.g., Apache) or database server (e.g., MySQL).

### Script:
    
 A script is a sequence of commands or instructions written in a scripting language like Bash, Python, or Perl. Scripts are used to automate tasks and can be executed to perform various operations on a Linux system. They are often used for system administration, data processing, and other repetitive tasks.
    
### Process:
    
A process is a running instance of a program in the Linux operating system. It is an independent unit that has its own memory space, system resources, and execution environment. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) and can run in the foreground or background. Processes can be started by users, scripts, or as part of system services.

### Daemon:
    
A daemon is a background process that runs on a Linux system, typically without any direct user interaction. Daemons are often started at system boot and continue to run in the background, providing various services or tasks. Common examples of daemons include web servers, print spoolers, and network services like SSH.

### Threads:
    
Threads are smaller units of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same memory space, resources, and file descriptors. Threads allow for concurrent execution within a process, enabling more efficient multitasking. Multithreading is commonly used in applications where parallelism or concurrency is needed.

### Job:
    
In the context of the Linux shell (e.g., Bash), a job refers to a single command or a sequence of commands that are executed as a single unit. Jobs can be run in the foreground or background. Users can manage jobs using built-in shell commands like `bg` (background), `fg` (foreground), and `jobs` (list running jobs).

## Commands

### `systemctl`

This command is used to control system services

```bash
$ systemctl [option] [servicename].service
```

|Option|Description|
|:-------|:------------|
|start|start an application|
|stop|stop an application|
|status|check the current status of an application|
|enabled|configure application to start on boot|
|disabled|configure application to not start on boot|
|restart|restart an application|
|list-units --all|get a list of all services|

### `ps`

shows the processes of the current shell described by the following columns:

- PID = the unique process ID
- TTY = terminal type that the user logged-in to
- TIME = amount of CPU in minutes and seconds that the process has been running
- CMD = name of the command

|Option|Description|
|:-------|:------------|
|-e|show all running processes|
|aux|show all running processes in BSD format|
|-ef|show all running processes in full format listing|
|-u <user_name>| show all processes being run by a specific user|

### `top`

shows the linux processes and it provides a real time view of the running system with a summary of information of the system and list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the linux kernel described by the following columns:

- PID = the unique process ID
- USER = username of owner of task
- PR = scheduling priority of the process
- NI = `Nice Value` - negative nice value implies higher priority
- VIRT = total virtual memory used by the task
- RES = memory consumed by the process in RAM
- SHR = amount of shared memory used by a task
- S = process state in the single letter form
- %CPU = CPU usage

### `kill`

used to terminate processes manually. Sends a signal the ultimately kills a particular process or group of processes via process id. Used when the systemctl stop does not work 

```bash
$ kill [OPTION] [PID]
```

- ***OPTION*** = signal name or signal number/ID
- ***PID*** = process ID

`kill -l` - to get a list of all signal names/numbers
`kill -1` - Restart
`kill -2` - Interrupt from the keyboard just like `Ctrl C`
`kill -9` - Forcefully kill the process
`kill -15` - Killing a process gracefully
`killall` - Kill all processes
`pkill` - kill via process name

### `crontab`

used to schedule tasks

|Options|Description|
|:--------|:------------|
|-e|Edit the crontab|
|-l|List the contab entries|
|-r|remove the crontab|
|crond|crontab daemon/service that manages scheduling|

![[Pasted image 20231023193246.png]]

Example: create  crontab entry by scheduling a task

```bash
$ crontab -e

# In File
21 16 * 10 * echo "Spooky Season" >> crontab_entry

$ wq!
```

By Default there are 4 different types of cronjobs
 - Hourly
 - Daily
 - Weekly
 - Monthly
All the above are setup in
- `/etc/cron.____`
The timing for each are set in
- `/etc/anacrontab --` (Except hourly `/etc/cron.d/0hourly`)
### `at`

allows you to schedule jobs but only once. When the command runs it will enter interactive mode and you can get out by pressing `Ctrl D`

- `at HH:MM PM` = Schedule a job
- `atq` = List the at entries
- `atrm #` = Remove at entry
- `atd` = at daemon/service that manages scheduling

Example: Create at entry by scheduling a task

```bash
$ at 04:45 PM

# In FIle
echo "Hello World"

Ctrl D
```

## Process Management

1. **Background**:
    
    - **Why**: You run processes in the background when you want them to execute independently of your current terminal session. This is useful for multitasking and for running long-running tasks that don't require your constant attention.
    - **When**:
        - When running commands that take a long time to complete.
        - For starting server processes and daemons.
        - When you want to continue using the terminal for other tasks.
    - **Commands**:
        - `&` symbol: Appending `&` to a command runs it in the background.
        - `bg`: Resume a stopped or paused process in the background.
    - **Example**:
        
```bash
$ long_running_task & bg
```
        
2. **Foreground**:
    
    - **Why**: Processes run in the foreground when you want to interact with them directly, monitor their progress, and provide input if necessary. They block the terminal until they finish.
    - **When**:
        - When running interactive programs.
        - For tasks that require your immediate attention.
    - **Commands**:
        - Running a command without `&` runs it in the foreground by default.
        - `fg`: Bring a background process to the foreground.
    - **Example**:

```bash
$ interactive_program & fg
```
        
3. **After Exit (nohup)**:
    
    - **Why**: You use the `nohup` command to run processes that should continue running even after you log out or exit the terminal. It prevents the process from receiving the SIGHUP (hang up) signal when you disconnect.
    - **When**:
        - For long-running tasks that you want to survive your session.
        - Running background tasks on remote servers or in SSH sessions.
    - **Commands**:
        - `nohup`: Prepend the command with `nohup` to run it after exit.
    - **Example**:
        
```bash
$ nohup long_running_task &

or

$ nohup process > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
        

Using these approaches, you can effectively manage processes based on your specific needs, whether it's running tasks concurrently, interacting with them in real-time, or ensuring they persist even after you log out.

#### Other Commands

- `nice` - give a process a specific priority

```bash
nice -n 5 sleep 10
```

- `jobs` - view scheduled jobs

### `dmesg`

used to display kernel (warning) messages, including information about hardware, drivers, and system events.

```bash
$ dmesg | more
```

This command displays a log of kernel messages from the current session and may require superuser (root) privileges to access some messages.

### `iostat 1`

provides input and output (I/O) statistics for devices and partitions on a Linux system. Adding `1` as an argument makes it update the statistics every second.

```bash

### Special Permissions

All permissions on a file or directory are referred to as bits
### `setuid`

bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective user id of the owner instead of the executor (e.g. passwd command) -> `/etc/shadow`
### `setgid`

bit tells Linux to run a program with the effective group id of the owner instead of the executor (e.g. locate or wall command)
### `sticky bit`

a bit set on files/directories that allows only the owner or root to delete those files

#### Assigning Special Permissions

- Assign special permissions at the user level
```bash
# Add
$ chmod u+s xyz.sh

# Remove
$ chmod u-s xyz.sh
```

- Assign special permissions at the group level
```bash
# Add
$ chmod g+s xyz.sh

# Remove
$ chmod g-s xyz.sh
```

- Find all executables in linux with setuid and setgid permissions
```bash
$ find / -prem /6000 -type f
```

- Sticky Bit 
It is assigned to the last bit of permissions
	- `-rwx rwx rwt`
