## **System/General Logs**: 

System or general logs are logs that record events and activities related to the operating system itself. These logs typically include information about system startup/shutdown, hardware detection, kernel events, system errors, and system service status. They provide a detailed record of system-level activities and are useful for troubleshooting system-related issues.
    
## **Application Logs**: 

Application logs record events and activities generated by applications running on a system. These logs contain information about application startup/shutdown, errors, warnings, exceptions, user interactions, and performance metrics. Application logs help developers and administrators diagnose application-specific issues, track user behavior, and optimize application performance.
    
## **Security Logs**: 

Security logs, also known as audit logs or event logs, record security-related events and activities on a system. These logs include information about authentication attempts, access control changes, privilege escalation, security policy violations, malware detections, and intrusion detection alerts. Security logs are essential for monitoring and investigating security incidents, detecting unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.
    
## **Setup Logs**: 
Setup logs record events and activities related to the installation, configuration, and setup of software or hardware components on a system. These logs contain information about installation progress, configuration changes, system initialization, and setup errors. Setup logs help administrators track the installation and configuration process, troubleshoot setup issues, and ensure proper deployment of new software or hardware.
    
## **Syslog**: 

Syslog is a standard protocol used for logging and forwarding log messages in a networked environment. Syslog messages can be generated by various devices, including routers, switches, servers, firewalls, and network appliances. Syslog messages are classified into severity levels ranging from 0 to 7, where lower numbers indicate more severe conditions:
    
- **Emergency (0)**: System is unusable. This level is typically reserved for catastrophic events that require immediate attention, such as system crashes or major hardware failures.
- **Alert (1)**: Action must be taken immediately. This level is used for critical conditions that require immediate attention, such as loss of network connectivity or disk space exhaustion.
- **Critical (2)**: Critical conditions. This level is used for critical system errors or failures that require prompt attention, such as application crashes or database corruption.
- **Error (3)**: Error conditions. This level is used for non-critical errors or failures that do not affect system functionality, such as configuration errors or invalid user input.
- **Warning (4)**: Warning conditions. This level is used for warning messages indicating potential issues or abnormal conditions, such as resource depletion or system performance degradation.
- **Notice (5)**: Normal but significant conditions. This level is used for informational messages that may be of interest but do not require immediate action, such as system startup/shutdown messages or configuration changes.
- **Informational (6)**: Informational messages. This level is used for general informational messages, such as user login/logout events or system status updates.
- **Debug (7)**: Debugging messages. This level is used for debugging information or diagnostic messages that are useful for troubleshooting issues or tracing system behavior.


## **History/Change Logs**: 

History or change logs record historical events and changes made to system configurations, files, or settings over time. These logs document additions, modifications, deletions, and updates to system resources, user accounts, application configurations, and system settings. History/change logs help administrators track system changes, audit system activity, and roll back changes if necessary.
