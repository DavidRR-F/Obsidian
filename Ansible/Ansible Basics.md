## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and provisioning. It aims to provide a simple, yet powerful, automation engine that operates in a 'push-based' setup. In Ansible, control nodes manage machines over SSH (without requiring agent installation on the remote machines), using YAML to define reusable descriptions of systems. Its design emphasizes minimalism and ease of use, where complex tasks are handled through human-readable playbooks that describe the desired state of systems. Ansible automates repetitive tasks, enables scalability, and manages complex deployments, helping to increase efficiency and ensure consistent environments across multiple setups.
