While you can run a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT` (CETAS) statement in a script whenever you need to transform data, it's good practice to encapsulate the transformation operation in stored procedure. This approach can make it easier to operationalize data transformations by enabling you to supply parameters, retrieve outputs, and include additional logic in a single procedure call.

For example, the following code creates a stored procedure that drops the external table if it already exists before recreating it with order data for the specified year:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_special_orders_by_year @order_year INT
AS
BEGIN

	-- Drop the table if it already exists
	IF EXISTS (
                SELECT * FROM sys.external_tables
                WHERE name = 'SpecialOrders'
            )
        DROP EXTERNAL TABLE SpecialOrders

	-- Create external table with special orders
	-- from the specified year
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE SpecialOrders
		WITH (
			LOCATION = 'special_orders/',
			DATA_SOURCE = files,
			FILE_FORMAT = ParquetFormat
		)
	AS
	SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, OrderTotal
	FROM
		OPENROWSET(
			BULK 'sales_orders/*.csv',
			DATA_SOURCE = 'files',
			FORMAT = 'CSV',
			PARSER_VERSION = '2.0',
			HEADER_ROW = TRUE
		) AS source_data
	WHERE OrderType = 'Special Order'
	AND YEAR(OrderDate) = @order_year
END
```

In addition to encapsulating Transact-SQL logic, stored procedures also provide the following benefits:

## Reduces client to server network traffic

The commands in a procedure are executed as a single batch of code; which can significantly reduce network traffic between the server and client because only the call to execute the procedure is sent across the network.

## Provides a security boundary

Multiple users and client programs can perform operations on underlying database objects through a procedure, even if the users and programs don't have direct permissions on those underlying objects. The procedure controls what processes and activities are performed and protects the underlying database objects; eliminating the requirement to grant permissions at the individual object level and simplifies the security layers.

## Eases maintenance

Any changes in the logic or file system locations involved in the data transformation can be applied only to the stored procedure; without requiring updates to client applications or other calling functions.

## Improved performance

Stored procedures are compiled the first time they're executed, and the resulting execution plan is held in the cache and reused on subsequent runs of the same stored procedure. As a result, it takes less time to process the procedure.
