## Flashcards

#Q  #AOSR/efnjd
What is IEEE 802.1q or Dot1Q?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/6erg
The most common VLAN tagging method. It inserts a VLAN tag into the Ethernet frame header, specifying the VLAN ID
***
What are the 8 levels of Syslog's Logging system (0-7)?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/1u4f
0: Emergency
1: Alerts
2: Critical
3: Error
4: Warning 
5: Notices
6: Informational
7: Debug
***
What is a MDF?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/7lmn
A Main Distribution Frame is a Diagram of a centrialized point in the network
where the primary network equipment and external communication links converge
***
What is a LDAP?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/1hnh
Lightweight Direct Access Protocol, It is a protocol used for accessing and
maintaining distributed directory information over an IP network.
LDAP has two main goals: to store data in the LDAP directory and authenticate users to access the directory
***
What is NAT and PAT?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/reeb
Network Address Translation, its a way to map multiple private addresses insde a
LAN to multiple public IPs (one-to-one). Similarly Port Address Translation is
a way to map multiple private addresses insde a LAN to a public IPs (many-to-one)
***
What is a Duplex and what is Half and Full Duplex?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/55qf
I duplex is a method of describing data transmission and reseption over one
channel. Half-Duplex allows bi-directional trasnmission but only from one
direction at a time while Full-Duplex allows for simultaious transmission in
both directions.
***
What 802.11 Standards are in the 5GHz range?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/3fff
802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax
***
What are the Max Rates (Bandwidths) for 802.11: a, b, g, n, ac, ax
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/3ap3
a: 54Mbps
b: 11Mbps
g: 54Mbps
n: 600Mbps
ac: 1.3-2.3Gbps
ax: 9.6-14Gbps
***
What 802.11 Standards are in the 2.4GHz range?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/15dm
802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n
***
What is the most common Cable, Impedance, and Connector for a Coaxial Cable?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/53up
Type: RG-6
Impedance: 75 Ohms
Connector F-Type

| :---- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Cat5  | 100 meters | 100 Mbps up to 1 Gbps                                 |
| Cat5e | 100 meters | 1 Gbps (Better EMI Protection)                        |
| Cat6  | 55 meters  | 10 Gbps (only up to 55 meters with 10GBASE-T network) |
| Cat7  | 100 meters | 10+ Gbps                                              |
| Cat8  | 100 meters | 25 Gbps (40 Gbps at 30 meters, 40GBASE-T network)     |

***
What is the SMF and MMF?
? #AOSR/efnjd/m/na56
Single-Mode Fiber, Designed for long distance communication and are smaller, use
lasers
Multi-Mode Fiber, used for short distance communication are are larger, use LEDs
***

? #AOSR/efnjd/m/2rta
LC: popular for its high-density applications
SC: known for their performance and reliability
ST: used in network environments
FC: stable and robust connection for single-mode and multi-mode fiber
***
What is eDiscovery?
?
refers to the process by which electronic data is sought, located, secured, 
and searched with the intent of using it as evidence in a civil or criminal legal case
including: Identification, Preservation, Collection, and Analysis
***
What is OSPF?
?
Open Shortest Path First, A link-state routing protocol that uses a method of flooding to 
exchange link information within an Autonomous System (AS), creating a map of the network 
to determine the shortest path
***
What is BGP?
?
Border Gateway Protocol, An exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and 
reachability information among autonomous systems on the internet
