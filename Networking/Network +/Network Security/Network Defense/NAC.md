Network Access Control (NAC) is a security solution that enforces policy compliance on devices attempting to access network resources, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to the network and that those devices comply with the organization's security policies. NAC systems can assess and remediate a device's security posture before allowing access, providing continuous monitoring of devices once they are on the network.

### Key Functions of NAC

- **Device Authentication**: NAC verifies the identity of devices trying to connect to the network using various authentication methods, such as 802.1X, MAC address filtering, or credentials.
- **Policy Enforcement**: It enforces security policies by controlling access to the network based on device compliance. Policies can be based on device type, role, patch level, antivirus status, and more.
- **Posture Assessment**: NAC assesses the security posture of a device before granting access, checking for up-to-date security software, operating system patches, and other security configurations.
- **Quarantine and Remediation**: Non-compliant devices can be quarantined to a separate network segment where they can be brought into compliance (e.g., through patching or antivirus updates) before gaining full network access.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: NAC solutions continuously monitor devices on the network to ensure they remain compliant with security policies. If a device falls out of compliance, it can be re-assessed, blocked, or quarantined.

### Benefits of NAC

- **Enhanced Security**: By ensuring that only compliant devices can access the network, NAC significantly reduces the risk of malware infections and data breaches.
- **Improved Visibility**: NAC provides comprehensive visibility into every device on the network, including type, ownership, operating system, and security posture, aiding in inventory management and incident response.
- **Access Management**: It enables granular control over network access, allowing organizations to define policies for different user groups, device types, and network segments.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: NAC helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements by enforcing security policies and documenting compliance.
