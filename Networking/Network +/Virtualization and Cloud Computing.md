# Hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). It allows multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host, with each OS appearing to have the host's processor, memory, and other resources all to itself. The hypervisor manages these resources, ensuring that each VM operates independently and is isolated from others, thereby optimizing resource utilization and enabling greater flexibility in hardware use.

### Types of Hypervisors

Hypervisors can be classified into two main types:

#### Type 1: Bare Metal Hypervisors

- **Definition**: These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. They do not require a host operating system.
- **Examples**: VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (when installed as a standalone hypervisor), and Xen.
- **Use Cases**: They are commonly used in enterprise environments where performance, scalability, and security are critical.

#### Type 2: Hosted Hypervisors

- **Definition**: These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system just like other computer programs. They manage guest operating systems but are one level removed from the physical hardware, as they go through the host OS.
- **Examples**: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.
- **Use Cases**: They are typically used for development, testing, and educational purposes where ease of use and flexibility are more important than performance.

### Key Functions of Hypervisors

- **Resource Allocation**: Hypervisors allocate hardware resources such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth to each VM.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that VMs are isolated from one another, such that the failure or security breach of one VM does not affect others.
- **Independence**: Allows VMs to run different operating systems on the same physical machine.
- **Migration**: Facilitates the movement of VMs from one physical server to another without downtime, enhancing flexibility and resource optimization.

# Cloud Basics

  
Cloud computing has introduced a new paradigm for the deployment, management, and scaling of IT resources. Three fundamental concepts that define the capabilities and advantages of cloud computing are elasticity, scalability, and multitenancy. Here's a breakdown of each:

### Elasticity

Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability of a system to automatically provision and deprovision computing resources as needed to align with demand. This means that the cloud can dynamically expand or contract resource allocation (such as CPU power, memory, and storage) in real-time, ensuring that applications always have the resources they need without manual intervention.

- **Key Aspect**: Automatic adjustment of resources based on current demand.
- **Benefit**: Helps in managing fluctuating workloads efficiently, ensuring that users only pay for the resources they use.

### Example of Elasticity

A web application experiencing variable traffic: during peak times (e.g., holiday sales), the cloud infrastructure automatically scales up to handle the increased load, ensuring smooth user experiences. When the demand decreases, resources are scaled down to minimize costs.

### Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a cloud service to handle growth in workload by adding resources, either horizontally (adding more machines) or vertically (adding more power to existing machines). Unlike elasticity, which is automatic, scalability often requires some level of planning and configuration to determine how and when resources are added or removed.

- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)**: Involves adding more machines or instances to pool resources.
    
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)**: Entails upgrading the existing machines with more CPU, RAM, or storage.
    
- **Key Aspect**: The capacity to grow and manage increased demand over time.
    
- **Benefit**: Ensures that the infrastructure can support the growth of applications, users, and data without performance degradation.
    

### Example of Scalability

An e-commerce platform planning for growth: as the user base expands, the platform can scale by adding more servers (horizontal) or upgrading existing servers (vertical) to accommodate the increased number of transactions and data.

### Multitenancy

Multitenancy is a principle in cloud computing where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants. Multitenancy is a common feature in cloud services, allowing providers to efficiently utilize resources and offer services to a larger number of customers at a reduced cost.

- **Key Aspect**: One infrastructure or application instance running on the cloud serves multiple users or organizations.
- **Benefit**: Reduces costs for both providers and users by sharing resources among multiple tenants while maintaining data privacy and security.

### Example of Multitenancy

A cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system used by multiple organizations: Each organization (tenant) uses the same CRM application and infrastructure but has its own secure and isolated view of their data. The CRM provider benefits from economies of scale, while the tenants benefit from lower costs and the elimination of maintenance responsibilities.

## Cloud Computing Models

The cloud computing model offers various services that cater to different needs, from full applications ready for use to frameworks and infrastructures that provide more control and flexibility. The key service models are SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and there's also a crucial concept known as IaC. Here's an overview of each:

### SaaS (Software as a Service)

**Definition**: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Users access and use the software via a web browser without worrying about installation, maintenance, or infrastructure.

**Key Features**:

- No need for local installation or maintenance.
- Pay-as-you-go subscription models.
- Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Example**: Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**Definition**: PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure typically associated with the development process.

**Key Features**:

- Development tools, database management, and business analytics.
- Scalable runtime environments.
- Managed services for developers.

**Example**: Google App Engine, Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Services.

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**Definition**: IaaS offers virtualized computing resources over the internet. It provides the fundamental computing infrastructure: virtual servers, storage, and networking, which users can deploy and run arbitrary software, including operating systems and applications.

**Key Features**:

- Highly scalable and automated compute resources.
- Complete control over the computing infrastructure.
- Resources are purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Example**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

**Definition**: IaC is a key concept in DevOps and cloud computing that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

**Key Features**:

- Infrastructure automation for faster setup and scaling.
- Version control for infrastructure changes.
- Consistency and repeatability in environment provisioning.

**Example**: Tools and technologies that enable IaC include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible.

# NFV

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a network architecture concept that uses IT virtualization technologies to virtualize entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that may be connected or chained together to create communication services. NFV decouples network functions, such as firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems, from dedicated hardware appliances, allowing them to run in software on standardized computing hardware. This approach significantly increases flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in deploying and managing network services.

### Key Components of NFV

- **Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs)**: These are the individual network functions that have been abstracted from hardware into software solutions. Examples include virtual routers, virtual firewalls, and virtual WAN optimizers.
- **NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)**: The totality of hardware and software components across all physical domains that support the execution of VNFs. This includes servers, storage, and networking components, as well as virtualization layers.
- **Management and Orchestration (MANO)**: The framework responsible for managing and orchestrating NFV resources and services. MANO handles the deployment of VNFs, orchestrates service chaining, and ensures that resources are used efficiently.

### Benefits of NFV

- **Reduced Costs**: By leveraging standard server hardware to run network functions that previously required dedicated hardware, NFV can significantly reduce capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).
- **Increased Agility**: NFV allows network operators to deploy and scale network services on-demand, without the need for physical installation of equipment. This makes it easier to respond to changing market demands and deploy new services faster.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Virtualization allows for more efficient use of resources, as VNFs can be dynamically allocated computing power based on demand, leading to energy and space savings in data centers.
- **Enhanced Innovation**: With a more flexible and dynamic network environment, NFV opens up opportunities for innovation in network service offerings, including customized services for specific market segments or rapid deployment of new network technologies.

### Use Cases of NFV

- **Telecommunications Networks**: Many telecom providers are adopting NFV to modernize their core networks, reduce reliance on specialized hardware, and accelerate the rollout of new services, such as 5G.
- **Cloud Services**: Cloud service providers use NFV to offer scalable and flexible networking services to their customers, including virtual private networks (VPNs), firewalls, and load balancers.
- **Enterprise Networks**: Enterprises can use NFV to simplify the management of their network infrastructure, improve network security, and enhance business continuity planning.
