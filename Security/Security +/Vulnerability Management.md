## Identifying Vulnerabilities

Systematic practice of spotting and categorizing weaknesses in a system, network, or application that could potentially be exploited

**Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated method of probing, networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities
- Nessus
- OpenVAS

**Application Security**: Used to safeguard the software from being manipulated during its lifecycle
- ***Static Analysis***: Used to analyze an application's source code without executing it
- ***Dynamic Analysis***: Evaluates an application as it is being run to determine if there are any vulnerabilities in the application
	- OWASP ZAP
	- Burp Suite
	- Peach Fuzzer
- ***Package Monitoring***: Ensures that the libraries and components that the application depends on are secure and up-to-date
	- Snyk
	- Dependabot

**Penetration Testing**: Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture

**System and Process Audits**: Process that involves conducting a comprehensive review of the information systems, security, policies, and procedures

#### 4 Step Process
1. Planning - to track vulnerabilities and deploy fixes
2. Testing - evaluating patches and updates in a controlled environment
3. Implementing - deploying patches across devices and applications
4. Auditing - Verify effective patch implementation and check for post-implementation issues

## Threat Intelligence Feeds

Continuous steam of data related to potential or current threats to an organization's security that is collected, analyzed, and disseminated by security researchers, organization, or automated tools to provide near real time updates on various aspects of security:
- New malware signature
- Indicators of compromise 
- Malicious IP addresses
- URLs

**Threat Intelligence**: Continual process used to understand the threats faced by an organization

### Sources

**OSINT**: *Open-Source Intelligence*, Intelligence that is collected from publicly available sources including reports, forums, news articles, blogs, and social media posts
- Alien Vault Open Threat Exchange
- SANS Internet Storm Center
- Security Researcher Forms/Blogs

**Proprietary or Third-Party Feeds**: Threat intelligence feeds that are provided by commercial vendors, usually under a subscription service type of business model
- FireEye
- McAfee
- Symantec

**Information Sharing Organizations**: Organizations and alliances that share threat intelligence among their members

**Dark Web**: Part of the Internet that is intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard web browsers

## Responsible Disclosure Programs

Term used to describe the ethical practice where a security researcher discloses information about vulnerabilities in a software, hardware or online service.

This process secures the vulnerability until the software developer deploys a fix

### Bug Bountys
Encourage cybersecurity researchers to find and report vulnerabilities that are both internally and externally available
- HakerOne
- Bugcrowd
- Synack

#### Benefits
1. Help increase the security of the organization
2. Fosters community collaboration
3. Very cost-effective

## Analyzing Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability Confirmation**: Numerous vulnerabilities can be detected in vulnerability scanning. Part of vulnerability management process is analyzing each alert to determine if it is a:

- True Positive - Correctly detects real vulnerability
- False Positive - Incorrectly states vulnerability exists
- True Negative - Correctly detects no vulnerability
- False Negative - Incorrectly states no vulnerability exists

### Prioritize Vulnerabilities

Ranking vulnerabilities by severity and impact on the organization by several factors:

- Ease of exploitation
- Magnitude of damage
- Importance of system

### Classifying Vulnerabilities

Categorizing the identified vulnerabilities based on factors such as:

- Type of threat
- Impact on organization
- Systems/Data affected

**CVE**: *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*, System that provides a standardized way to uniquely identify and reference known vulnerabilities in software and hardware

**EF**: *Exposure Factor*, Used as a quantifiable metric to help a cybersecurity professional understand the exact percentage of an asset that is likely to be damaged or affected if a particular vulnerability is exploited

**Risk Tolerance**: Refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives and before action is deemed necessary to mitigate the risk
