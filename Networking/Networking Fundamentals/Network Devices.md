# Host

**Hosts** are any device which *sends* of *retrieves* traffic. i.e. computers, laptops, phones, printers, servers, IoT devices, etc...

Hosts fall into one of two categories:
- **Clients**: The host initiating the requests
- **Servers**: The host that responds to the request

# IP Address

An **IP Address** is the identity of each host. When sending or receiving requests, the request specifies:
- **Source IP Address**: The identity of the machine sending the request
- **Destination IP Address**: The Identity of the machine to receive the request
